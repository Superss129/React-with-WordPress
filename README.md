:fire: Example of react application with WordPress REST API

WordPress is a topic that elicits strong opinions from developers, both positive and negative. However, even the most vocal detractors cannot ignore a particular feature that has already revolutionized the way we utilize this widely-used CMS.

The WordPress REST API represents a significant advancement for frontend developers aiming to harness the power of JavaScript tools such as React.js in conjunction with WordPress.

In this demo, my objective is to determine if this integration truly lives up to its reputation as a game-changer and to dispel any misconceptions surrounding it.

To accomplish this, I will utilize WordPress as a backend and leverage the WordPress REST API to seamlessly provide data to a polished React.js single-page application (SPA).

The tutorial covers the following steps:

- Creating models using the WP Advanced Custom Fields plugin.
- Generating a custom endpoint.
- Setting up a React single-page application.
- Consuming the JSON REST API with React.
